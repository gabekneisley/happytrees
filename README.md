#happytrees
Easy, beautiful UI elements for the real world
==========

##Design goals
Happytrees is a front-end user experience framework. As such, it should be 
built to suit a particular user experience need. The idea is to abstract 
design elements that aren't part of the implementer's core UX and allow easy 
replacement or enhancement of elements that are.

Happytrees is explicitly themeable. It uses declarative UI elements that are 
abstracted from the design. Layout is also abstracted from presentation.
